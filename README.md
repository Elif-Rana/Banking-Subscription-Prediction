# Banking Dataset Prediction
This project aimed to analyze data from a bankâ€™s direct
marketing campaign and uncover relational contexts within the
data. The primary focus was on the analysis and preprocessing
of the data to reveal significant patterns and relationships.
Following this, machine learning models were developed to
predict whether customers would subscribe to a term deposit
account. The dataset included various customer demographic
information and campaign details. To enhance the robustness
of the models, ensemble methods such as Boosting and
Stacking were employed. The performance of the models was
evaluated using various metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1
score), and the best-performing model was selected. The anticipated gains from the project included developing data analysis
skills and gaining experience in discovering relational contexts
through the active application of data mining techniques.
